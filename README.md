## Summary
This project focuses on predicting liver disease using a dataset of 1700 records. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), key risk factors such as BMI, alcohol consumption, and liver function tests were identified using Weight of Evidence. Various machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier, and Naive Bayes, were trained and evaluated using ROC curves. Model calibration was performed on the Decision Tree, and hyperparameters were fine-tuned for both Decision Tree and Random Forest to address overfitting. Among the models tested, Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy, offering valuable insights for early detection and potential prevention of liver disease. The tool used for modelling is the programming language, Python.
## Data
